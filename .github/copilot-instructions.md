# Project-specific Copilot Instructions
- This project is a NestJS API that syncs Contentful 'Product' entries to MongoDB every hour, provides public paginated/filterable REST endpoints, private JWT-protected report endpoints, and is Dockerized.
- Use Mongoose for MongoDB integration.
- Use Swagger for API docs at /api/docs.
- Use best practices for modular NestJS code, DTOs, and validation.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI with test and lint steps.
- Use conventional commits and gitflow.
